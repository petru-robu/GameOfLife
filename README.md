# Game Of Life
<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>
The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. </p>
<p>
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>
  I have implemented the game in javascript using the p5 grpahics library. The game runs in a 2D grid in which I've implemented 
  a wrap-around logic. Some patterns of gliders, oscillators and other life forms can be loaded by clicking the respective buttons.
  Here you can see a screenshot of the implementation. I also invite you to check out the simulator on my github page, https://petru-robu.github.io, where you can interact with it.

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>While doing this project I have imporved on my programming skills, javascript and web technologies.</p>
